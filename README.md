## Orphanage

Members, each of you should have a folder named after your (in some cases, partial) initials, so feel free to dump all the stray, orphaned scripts you have here if you think they might have value for other people in the team or in the future to run certain optional steps in any of your analyses or pipelines. Ideally, fully-functioning and important scripts should go into the appropriate projects/teams' repositories, but sometimes some scripts just did not make the cut (yet) but you do not want to delete them. In this case, they can and should go into this Orphanage for recordkeeping and future foolproofing. Feel free to include a `README.md` inside your own folder if you want to document their identities.

### Tips
Tip 1: Please be kind to your scripts. Be it a one-liner, a stray awk script, a small custom Python function or class definition, and last but never the least, the one-time-use on-the-fly bash scripts you asked ChatGPT to draft up for you because you cannot be bothered to do so yourself and prefer to go make a cup of coffee in the meantime instead; they did something for you, and they might prove to be useful again in the future. Therefore, please make it a habit to leave helpful comments in your scripts, even if nobody ever opens the script file and read them. 

Tip 2: If you try to commit changes and there is an error, always `git pull --rebase` first, before trying `git push` again, because there is a high chance someone else updated or committed a new change in the repo while you were working on yours. 

Tip 3: Please name your script descriptively. They just look better.
